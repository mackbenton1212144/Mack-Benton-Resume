                    Done Right Services represents my longest-running entrepreneurial venture, launched when I was in 6th grade. 
                    What started as a neighborhood lawn care business has evolved into a successful handyman service. This 
                    experience has been invaluable in teaching me about business operations, customer relations, marketing, 
                    and project management. Through strategic reinvestment and continuous learning, I've expanded both services 
                    and customer base, building a reputation for quality work and reliability.
